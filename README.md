MachinaEar is an intelligent predictive maintenance system that transforms low-cost vibration and sound sensors into powerful diagnostic tools for small-scale industrial machinery. By “listening” to motors, bearings, and moving parts, MachinaEar can detect early signs of failure before breakdowns occur.
